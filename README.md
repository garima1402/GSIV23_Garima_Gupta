# Getting Started with Create React App
You may run the app by installing the node modules with command npm i or npm install.
I have used redux for state management  and data fetched from api can be checked via logger, 
It's visible in the developer console.
If i had more time , I'd improve the ui, I would have cleaned the code.
The application is functional, the routing, redux, api integrations are complete.
